Fuzzball.js
==========

Easy to use and powerful fuzzy string matching. 

This is a JavaScript port of the [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) Python library. Uses [fast-levenshtein](https://github.com/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein) for distance calculations. (with a slight modification to match the behavior of python-Levenshtein where substitutions are weighted 2 instead of 1 in ratio calculations. or specify an options.subcost to override)

Try it out on [runkit](https://runkit.com/npm/fuzzball)!

Requirements
============

-  jsdifflib
-  heap.js

Installation
============

Using NPM

    npm install fuzzball

Usage
=====

```js
var fuzz = require('fuzzball');
fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test");
        100
```

**Simple Ratio**

```js
fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!"); // "!" stripped in pre-processing by default
        100
```

**Partial Ratio**

```js
fuzz.partial_ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!");
        100
fuzz.partial_ratio("this is a test", "this is a test again!"); //still 100, substring of 2nd is a perfect match of the first
        100
```

**Token Sort Ratio**

```js
fuzz.ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear");
        91
fuzz.token_sort_ratio("fuzzy wuzzy was a bear", "wuzzy fuzzy was a bear");
        100
```

**Token Set Ratio** 

```js
fuzz.token_sort_ratio("fuzzy was a bear", "fuzzy fuzzy was a bear");
        84
fuzz.token_set_ratio("fuzzy was a bear", "fuzzy fuzzy was a bear"); 
        100
```

**Distance** (Levenshtein distance without any ratio calculations)

```js
fuzz.distance("fuzzy was a bear", "fozzy was a bear");
        1
```

**Other Scoring Options**

  * partial_token_set_ratio
  * partial_token_sort_ratio
  * WRatio
(WRatio is weighted based on relative string length, runs tests based on relative length and returns top score)

Blog post with overview of scoring algorithms can be found [**here**](http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/).

**Pre-Processing**

```js
// eh, don't need to clean it up..
var options = {full_process: false}; //non-alphanumeric will not be converted to whitespace if false, default true
fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!", options);
        97
```

Pre-processing run by default unless options.full_process is set to false, but can run separately as well. (so if searching same list repeatedly can only run once)

```js
fuzz.full_process("myt^eXt!");
        myt ext
```

**International** (a.k.a non-ascii)

```js
// currently full_process must be set to false if useCollator is true
// or non-roman alphanumeric will be removed (got a good locale-specific alphanumeric check in js?)
var options = {full_process: false, useCollator: true};
fuzz.ratio("this is Ã¤ test", "this is a test", options);
        100
```


**Extract** (search a list of choices for top results)

Simple: array of strings

```js
var query = "polar bear";
var choices = ["brown bear", "polar bear", "koala bear"];

results = fuzz.extract(query, choices);

[ [ 'polar bear', 100 ],
  [ 'koala bear', 80 ],
  [ 'brown bear', 60 ] ]
```

Less simple: array of objects with a processor function + options (all except query and choices are optional)

Processor function takes each choice and outputs the string which will be used for scoring. Default scorer is ratio.

```js
var query = "126abzx";
var choices = [{id: 345, modelnumber: "123abc"},{id: 346, modelnumber: "123efg"},{id: 347, modelnumber: "456abdzx"}];
var scorer = fuzz.partial_ratio;
var processor = function(choice) {return choice['modelnumber']}  // null = no processor, if just an array of strings
var limit = 2; // max number of results, 0 = no limit
var cutoff = 50; // lowest score to return
var options = {}; // (can specify non-default values for full_process, useCollator, force_ascii, subcost)

results = fuzz.extract(query, choices, scorer, processor, limit, cutoff, options);

[ [ { id: 345, modelnumber: '123abc' }, 67 ],
 [ { id: 347, modelnumber: '456abdzx' }, 57 ] ]
```
